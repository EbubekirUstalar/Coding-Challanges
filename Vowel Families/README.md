First of all I looked some examples over internet. 

I wanted to find a nice web site that has both questions and their solutions so that I can evaluate myself.

But without wasting much time, I did my first challenge on https://edabit.com/challenge/uwFHSRewNpmBNvbME

I am looking only "advanced problems" segment.


Description

Vowel Families

Published by: https://edabit.com/user/mNMQvcxKSSvqqMYCH

Key concepts: objects, sorting, strings

Language: Python

Write a function that select all words that shares the same vowels (in any ordering) as the first word in the list.

same_vowel_group(["toe", "ocelot", "maniac"]) ➞ ["toe", "ocelot"]

same_vowel_group(["many", "carriage", "emit", "apricot", "animal"]) ➞ ["many"]

same_vowel_group(["hoops", "chuff", "bot", "bottom"]) ➞ ["hoops", "bot", "bottom"]


Notes
- Words will contain only lowercase letters, and may contain whitespaces.
- Frequency does not matter (e.g. if "loopy", then you can include words with any number of o's, so long as they only contain o's, and not any other vowels).
- The question is that we need to find words that has the same vowels.

Notes to me
- I did not know what set function is and what we can do with it. I need to look for that.
