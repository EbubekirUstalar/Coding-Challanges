
I did my third challenge on https://edabit.com/challenge/6b8Px5m82nAgudhsy

Description

Slope to Angle Conversion

Published by: https://edabit.com/user/mNMQvcxKSSvqqMYCH

Key concepts: numbers, sorting

Language: Python


Write a function that returns the next largest number that can be created from the same digits as the input.
 
-----

Examples:

next_number(19) ➞ 91

next_number(3542) ➞ 4235

next_number(5432) ➞ 5432

next_number(58943) ➞ 59348

Notes
- If no larger number can be formed, return the number itself.
- Bonus: See if you can do this without generating all digit permutations.

-----

NOTES TO ME:
- First thing that comes to mind is getting all the permutations but the bonus says not to, so I tried to make that happen,
by just getting only bigger number up until our number but I could not do that. Some solutions includes that so it is nice to
look for them

- Moreover, from previous challanges I undestand that I need to know set function and I did some basic things to understand.
