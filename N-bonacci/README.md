Key concepts: math, numbers

Language: Python


N-bonacci numbers are generalisations of the fibonacci sequence, where the next term is always the sum of the previous N terms. By convention, the first (N-1) terms are all 0 and the Nth term is 1.

The initial 10 terms of the first 5 N-bonacci sequences are therefore:

1-bonacci = 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...
2-bonacci = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
3-bonacci = 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, ...
4-bonaaci = 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 29, ...
5-bonacci = 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
Write a function that returns the kth term of the N-bonacci sequence, for two integer arguments N and k.

Examples:

bonacci(1, 10) ➞ 1

bonacci(2, 10) ➞ 34

bonacci(3, 10) ➞ 44

bonacci(4, 10) ➞ 29

bonacci(5, 10) ➞ 16

NOTES TO ME:
- It was fun to solve, after I solved it I thought I start to understand the difference python among other programming laguages.
