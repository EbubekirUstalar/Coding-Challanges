I did my second challenge on https://edabit.com/challenge/jowQ2aeZut4vGyHyP




Description

Slope to Angle Conversion

Published by: https://edabit.com/user/7MRr7qZpuXEo66ZoR

Key concepts: algebra, math, number

Language: Python

Given a slope of a line, calculate and return the value of the angle of line (relative to the y -axis). For example, a horizontal line would be 90 degrees.

convert(1) ➞ 45

convert(0) ➞ 90

convert(-1) ➞ 135



Notes
-All values returned should be in degrees.
-All values returned should be rounded to the nearest whole number.
-The value to return must be strictly between 0 and 180.
-All inputs will be valid integer values.


NOTES TO ME:
I did not know we can import libraries, I spent most of the time searching for arctan and conversion.
